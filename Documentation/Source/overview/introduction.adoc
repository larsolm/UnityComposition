## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation website for the PiRho Soft Composition Framework! On this site you will find a comprehensive set of materials for learning and becoming familiar with the framework. We have several tutorials that cover all the basics, in depth topics on the main systems, a manual containing pages for each object type, and a complete api reference. Use the navigation menu on the left to find what you are looking for, or use the search box to filter the menu to only show pages containing a certain term.

At the top right of any page you can find a Pdf download link. Next to that is a link to our https://discord.gg/3tDcmBF[Discord^] server where we will be available to quickly respond to any questions or suggestions (whether you have purchased the asset yet or not).

We have a <<overview/roadmap.html,Roadmap>> in the navigation menu as well that we will be keeping up to date as our development plans evolve. This includes a bugs section that contains a list of the currently known issues. Below that is the <<overview/log-descriptions.html,Log Descriptions>> section. This is a complete glossary for all the messages the framework can print to the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Console.html[console^] with more information about what they mean and how to deal with them.

For beginners, your best bet is to start with the <<tutorials/getting-started-1.html,Getting Started Tutorial>>. This will walk you through creating a basic game using graphs, variables, and bindings. After that, there are more tutorial videos that can be viewed in any order depending on what you are looking to accomplish. After the tutorials, the various topics provide more detailed information about specific systems, such as <<topics/graphs-5.html,tips for debugging graphs>>, how to <<topics/graphs-8.html,implement your own nodes>>, and how to <<topics/variables-3.html,define objects in the editor>>.

In the manual you will find a page for each of the component and asset types. These pages can be accessed from inside the Unity editor using the image:help.png[help] icon in the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html[inspector^]. The manual explains how to use each object including the list of properties it supports. The reference pages expand on the manual with complete coverage of the code api for every type.
