## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the PiRho Soft Composition Framework! In these pagse you will find a comprehensive set of materials for learning and becoming familiar with the framework. We have several tutorials that cover all the basics, in depth topics on the main systems, a manual containing pages for each object type, and a complete api reference. Use the navigation menu on the left to find what you are looking for, or use the search box to filter the menu to only show pages containing a certain term.

At the top right of any page you can find a link to our https://discord.gg/3tDcmBF[Discord^] server where we will be available to quickly respond to any questions or suggestions (whether you have purchased the asset yet or not). Next to that is an email link if you would like to contact us that way instead.

We have a <<overview/roadmap.html,Roadmap>> in the navigation menu that we will be keeping up to date as our development plans evolve. This includes a bugs section that contains a list of the currently known issues. Below that is the <<overview/log-descriptions.html,Log Descriptions>> section. This is a complete glossary for all the messages the framework can print to the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Console.html[console^] with more information about what they mean and how to deal with them. If you encounter an error message that is not covered or any other problems, please https://discord.gg/HcXCFnM[let us know] and we will fix it as quickly as we can!

For beginners, your best bet is to start with the <<tutorials/getting-started/setup.html,Getting Started Tutorial>>. This will walk you through creating a basic game using graphs, variables, and bindings. Also in the tutorials section are several walkthrough videos which will explain the implementation of each of the example projects. And there are more tutorial videos covering various topics that can be viewed in any order.

The topics section includes documents that provide more detailed information about specific systems, such as <<topics/graphs/debugging.html,tips for debugging graphs>>, how to <<topics/graphs/custom-nodes.html,implement your own nodes>>, and how to <<topics/variables/defining-variables.html,define objects in the editor>>.

In the manual you will find a page for each of the component and asset types. These pages can be accessed from inside the Unity editor using the image:help.png[help] icon in the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html[inspector^]. The manual explains how to use each object including the list of properties it supports. The reference pages expand on the manual with complete coverage of the code api for every type.
