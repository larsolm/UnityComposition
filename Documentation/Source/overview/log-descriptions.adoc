## Log Descriptions

The following lists all the warning and error messages that may be printed to the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Console.html[Console^] by the Composition Framework. Each message has an associated id that corresponds to an entry in this list for easy searchability. For example the following image shows an error with id `CEEE`. Searching this page for an id will take you to the entry which will explain in more detail what the message means, the effect on execution, and potential ways to fix it.

### General Tips

When dealing with <<topics/variables-4.html,VariableReference>> errors, the <<topics/graphs-5.html,Watch Window>> can be extremely useful. Global variables can be investigated at any time and variables on a specific <<topics/graphs-1.html,InstructionGraph>> can be investigated by <<topics/graphs-5.html,setting a breakpoint>> on a node.

<<topics/variables-5.html,Expression>> errors can be harder to track down. If the text box containing the <<topics/variables-5.html,Expression>> is red, the issue is with the actual structure of the <<topics/variables-5.html,Expression>> and details will be displayed. In this case the error state will update as the <<topics/variables-5.html,Expression>> is modified so it is easy to see when the issue has been resolved. If the <<topics/variables-5.html,Expression>> is valid and an error is printed at runtime, the issue is usually related to a <<topics/variables-4.html,VariableReference>> and the above tip for using the <<topics/graphs-5.html,Watch Window>> applies.

### Warnings

#### CAANPIL

Unable to wait on Animation Player '{0}': the Animation Clip '{1}' was set to loop and would have never finished

[cols="1,8"]
|===
| {0} | The https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameObjects.html[GameObject^] containing the <<manual/animation-player.html,AnimationPlayer>> that triggered the warning.
| {1} | The https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationClips.html[AnimationClip^] that is being played.
|===

Effect:: The https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationClips.html[AnimationClip^] will still play successfully but the wait setting will be ignored.

Resolution:: Either tell the <<manual/animation-player.html,AnimationPlayer>> to play the animation without looping (i.e call _PlayAnimation_ instead of _PlayAnimationAndWait_ or clear the _WaitForCompletion_ flag if using a <<manual/play-animation-node.html,PlayAnimationNode>>) or change the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationClips.html[AnimationClip^] to one that doesn't loop.

#### CAAUPIL

Unable to wait on Audio Player '{0}': the Audio Clip '{1}' was set to loop and would have never finished

| {1} | The https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AudioClip.html.html[AudioClip^] that is being played.
|===

Effect:: The https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioClips.html[AudioClip^] will still play successfully but the wait setting will be ignored.

Resolution:: Either tell the <<manual/audio-player.html,AudioPlayer>> to play the sound without looping (call _PlaySound_ instead of _PlaySoundAndWait_ or clear the _WaitForCompletion_ flag if using a <<manual/play-sound-node.html,PlaySoundNode>>) or change the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioClips.html[AudioClip^] to one that doesn't loop.

#### CBBBWT

Bar Binding '{0}' has an Image with a type that is not 'Filled'

[cols="1,8"]
|===
| {0} | The https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameObjects.html[GameObject^] containing the <<manual/bar-binding.html,BarBinding>> that triggered the warning.
|===

Effect:: The https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Image.html[Image^] will have its _type_ set to `Filled` with default values for the other fill related properties.

Resolution:: Change the `Image Type` of the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Image.html[Image^] to `Filled`.

#### CBLBMT

Unable to create item for List Binding '{0}': the Template is null

[cols="1,8"]
|===
| {0} | The <<manual/list-binding.html,ListBinding>> that triggered the warning.
|===

Effect:: The <<manual/list-binding.html,ListBinding>> will do nothing.

Resolution:: Set the _Template_ property of the <<manual/list-binding.html,ListBinding>>.

#### CDONIO

Unable to disable object for node '{0)': the object '{1}' is not a GameObject, Behaviour, or Renderer

[cols="1,8"]
|===
| {0} | The <<manual/disable-object-node.html,DisableObjectNode>> that triggered the warning.
| {1} | The <<topics/variables-4.html,VariableReference>> assigned to _Target_ that resolved to an invalid type.
|===

Effect:: The <<manual/disable-object-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> will do nothing.

Resolution:: Change _Target_ so it resolves to either a https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameObjects.html[GameObject^], https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Behaviour.html[Behaviour^], or https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Renderer.html[Renderer^].

#### CEBFC

Unable to bind enabled state for binding '{0}': the Command '{1}' failed with error '{2}'

[cols="1,8"]
|===
| {0} | The <<manual/enable-binding.html,EnableBinding>> that triggered the warning.
| {1} | The name of the command that failed.
| {2} | The error message reported by the command.
|===

Effect:: The enabled state of _Object_ will not be changed.

Resolution:: If the reported error ({2}) indicates a parameter is invalid, the _Condition_ <<topics/variables-5.html,Expression>> is calling the command incorrectly. Otherwise, the command itself has an error and needs to be edited directly. The message should provide details on how to go about fixing the issue.

[cols="1,8"]
|===
| {0} | The <<manual/enable-binding.html,EnableBinding>> that triggered the warning.
| {1} | The final statement in the _Condition_ <<topics/variables-5.html,Expression>>.
|===

Effect:: The enabled state of _Object_ will not be changed.

Resolution:: Change _Condition_ so that the final statement results in a bool value, potentially by using a comparison operation.

#### CEBMV

Unable to bind enabled state for binding '{0}': the expression is empty

[cols="1,8"]
|===
| {0} | The <<manual/enable-binding.html,EnableBinding>> that triggered the warning.
|===

Effect:: The enabled state of _Object_ will not be changed.

Resolution:: Set the _Condition_ <<topics/variables-5.html,Expression>>.

|===

Effect:: The caller ({0}) will still be returned the result and how that result is used is dependent on the specific scenario.

Resolution:: Change the expression defined on the caller ({0}) so that the final statement results in the expected type ({3}).

#### CEONIO

Unable to enable object for node '{0)': the object '{1}' is not a GameObject, Behaviour, or Renderer

[cols="1,8"]
|===
| {0} | The <<manual/enable-object-node.html,EnableObjectNode>> that triggered the warning.
| {1} | The <<topics/variables-4.html,VariableReference>> assigned to _Target_ that resolved to an invalid type.
|===

Effect:: The <<manual/enable-object-node.html,EnableObjectNode>> will do nothing.
