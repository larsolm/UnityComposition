### Description

### Public Fields

<<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> _Next_::

The <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> to run when this node completes.

<<reference/load-scene-node-scene-source.html,SceneSource>> _Source_::

Specifies how the scene to load is retrieved.

<<reference/scene-reference.html,SceneReference>> _Scene_::

If _Source_ is `Value`, holds the scene to load.

<<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReference>> _SceneVariable_::

If _Source_ is `Variable`, references the scene to load. If the resolved value is an `Int`, the scene will be loaded by index. If it is a `String`, it will be loaded by name.

string _SceneName_::

If _Source_ is `Name`, the name of the scene to load.

int _SceneIndex_::

If _Source_ is `Index`, the build index of the scene to load.

bool _WaitForCompletion_::

If this is `true` (the default), the node will block until the scene has been loaded. Otherwise the scene will be loaded and the graph will continue in parallel.

bool _CleanupAssets_::

If this is `true` (the default), https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets.html[Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets^] will be called after the scene has been loaded.

bool _Additive_::

If this is `true` (the default), the scene will be loaded in additive mode, meaning all other loaded scenes will remain loaded. If this is `false`, all currently loaded scenes will be unloaded first.
