## PlayTransition

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.PlayTransition : <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>>

### Description

Plays a <<reference/transition.html,Transition>> on the <<reference/transition-manager.html,TransitionManager>>.

### Public Fields

<<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> _Next_::

The <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> to run when this node completes.

<<reference/transition-variable-source.html,TransitionVariableSource>> _Transition_::

The <<reference/transition.html,Transition>> to play.

<<reference/transition-phase.html,TransitionPhase>> _Phase_::

The <<reference/transition-phase.html,TransitionPhase>> to play the <<reference/transition.html,Transition>> in.

bool _AutoFinish_::

If this is `true`, the <<reference/transition.html,Transition>> will be ended as soon as it has completed. If this is `false`, the <<reference/transition.html,Transition>> will persist in its final state until another <<reference/transition.html,Transition>> (perhaps the same one with a different <<reference/transition-phase.html,TransitionPhase>>) is started.

bool _WaitForCompletion_::

If this is `true`, this node will not complete until _Transition_ has completed. Otherwise, this node will complete immediately and the <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>> will continue.
