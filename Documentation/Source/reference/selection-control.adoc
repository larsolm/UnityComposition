## SelectionControl

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.SelectionControl : <<reference/interface-control.html,InterfaceControl>>

### Description

Add this to a <<reference/menu.html,Menu>> with a <<reference/menu-input.html,MenuInput>> to allow a <<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>> to be selected.

### Public Properties

bool _IsRunning_ _(read only)_::

This will be `true` when a selection is in progress.

bool _IsSelectionRequired_ _(read only)_::

This will be `true` if the current selection requires an item to be selected.

bool _IsClosing_ _(read only)_::

This will be `true` when the selection will be closed on the next frame.

bool _HasFocusedItem_ _(read only)_::

This will be `true` when the <<reference/menu.html,Menu>> has a focused <<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>>.

bool _HasSelectedItem_ _(read only)_::

This will be `true` when a selection has been made.

<<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>> _FocusedItem_ _(read only)_::

The <<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>> that currently has focus, or `null` if there is no focused item.

int _FocusedIndex_ _(read only)_::

The index of the <<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>> that currently has focus, or `-1` if there is no focused item.

<<reference/variable-value.html,VariableValue>> _FocusedValue_ _(read only)_::

The value associated with the <<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>> that currently has focus, or `VariableValue.Empty` if there is no focused item.

<<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>> _SelectedItem_ _(read only)_::

The <<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>> that has been selected, or `null` if no selection has been made.

int _SelectedIndex_ _(read only)_::

The index of the <<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>> that has been selected, or `-1` if no selection has been made.

<<reference/variable-value.html,VariableValue>> _SelectedValue_ _(read only)_::

The value associated with the <<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>> that has been selected, or `VariableValue.Empty` if no selection has been made.

### Public Methods

void Show(<<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> _variables_, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable-1[IEnumerable^]<<<reference/menu-item-template.html,MenuItemTemplate>>> _items_, bool _isSelectionRequired_, bool _resetIndex_)::

Show _items_ on the sibling <<reference/menu.html,Menu>>. This will start a https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html[coroutine^] that waits for a selection to be made. If _isSelectionRequired_ is `true`, the <<reference/menu.html,Menu>> will be required to have a selection made. If _resetIndex_ is `true`, the <<reference/menu.html,Menu's>> focus will be set to the first item, otherwise the focus will not change. _variables_ is used with _items_ to resolve any <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReferences>>.

void Select(<<reference/menu-item.html,MenuItem>> _item_)::

Makes _item_ the selected item and closes the menu.

void Close()::

Closes the menu. If _IsSelectionRequired_ is `true`, this will only succeed if a selection has been made.

### Protected Methods

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html[Transform^] GetItemParent() _(virtual)_::

Implement this in subclasses to specify the https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html[Transform^] that created items should be added to. By default this is the https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html[Transform^] of this object.

void OnInitialize() _(virtual)_::

Implement this in subclasses to perform setup when _Show_ is called after the items have been created and menu has been set up.

void OnCreate() _(virtual)_::

Implement this in subclasses to perform setup when _Show_ is called after the items have been created but before the menu has been set up.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.IEnumerator[IEnumerator^] Run() _(virtual)_::

Implement this in subclasses to perform custom handling for waiting for a selection. The default implementation will do nothing but yield until the control closes.
