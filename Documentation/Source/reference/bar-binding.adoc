### Public Fields

<<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReference>> _AmountVariable_::

The int or float variable indicating the amount the bar should be filled.

<<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReference>> _TotalVariable_::

The int or float variable indicating the 'full' amount. https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/UI.Image.html[Image._fillAmount_^] is set to the result of _AmountVariable_ / _TotalVariable_.

The color to set https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/UI.Image.html[Image._color_^] to depending on the current fill amount.

float _Speed_::

If this is greater than 0, the fill amount will animate when it changes. The value specifies the speed of the animation in percent per second. So, for example, a value of 0.1 would cause the bar to change its fill at a rate of 10% every second.

bool _UseScaledTime_::

If this is set, _Speed_ will be based on https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time-time.html[scaled time^], otherwise it will be based on https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time-unscaledTime.html[real time^].
