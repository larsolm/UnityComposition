## InstructionTrigger

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.InstructionTrigger : https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^]

### Description

Add this to an object to provide an interface for specifying an <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>> in the editor that can be run from code. This is also used as a base class for behaviours that run <<reference/instruction-graph.html,graphs>> on certain events. Built in implementations are:

* <<reference/button-graph-trigger.html,ButtonGraphTrigger>>
* <<reference/click-graph-trigger.html,ClickGraphTrigger>>
* <<reference/enable-graph-trigger.html,EnableGraphTrigger>>
* <<reference/start-graph-trigger.html,StartGraphTrigger>>

Additionally, <<reference/collision-graph-trigger.html,CollisionGraphTrigger>> is included that, while not deriving from this class, performs a similar function.

### Public Fields

<<reference/instruction-caller.html,InstructionCaller>> _Graph_::

The <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>> to execute when _Run_ is called.

### Public Methods

void Run()::

Runs _Graph_ using the <<reference/composition-manager.html,CompositionManager>>. <<reference/composition-manager.html,CompositionManager._DefaultStore_>> is used to read input variables from and `this` is used as the <<reference/instruction-store.html,_Context_>>.
