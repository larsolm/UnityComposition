## VariableBinding

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.VariableBinding : https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^]

### Description

Derived from this class to provide support for automatically updating properties of loaded https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html[GameObjects^] (for instance, user interface elements) based on <<reference/variable-value.html,VariableValues>> stored in the <<topics/variables-1.html,Variables System>>.

Read the <<topics/bindings-1.html,Bindings Topic>> for a complete overview of how to use bindings and how to implement custom bindings.

### Static Methods

void UpdateBinding(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html[GameObject^] _obj_, string _group_, <<reference/binding-animation-status.html,BindingAnimationStatus>> _status_)::

Triggers an update for bindings on _obj_ and its descendants. If _group_ is `null` or empty, all bindings will be updated, otherwise all bindings with _BindingGroup_ matching _group_ will be updated. Optionally pass a <<reference/binding-animation-status.html,BindingAnimationStatus>> instance as _status_ to access information about bindings that perform an animation or otherwise take multiple frames to complete.

void UpdateBinding(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html[GameObject^] _obj_, string _group_, <<reference/binding-animation-status.html,BindingAnimationStatus>> _status_, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.List-1[List^]<<<reference/variable-binding.html,VariableBinding>>> _bindings_)::

Performs the same function as the other _UpdateBinding_ method but uses _bindings_ as a location to store the <<reference/variable-binding.html,VariableBindings>> looked up on _obj_. It is not necessary to use this overload exception when called from the _UpdateBinding_ instance method of a <<reference/variable-binding.html,VariableBinding>> subclass.

### Public Fields

string _BindingGroup_::

An arbitrary string used to allow the binding to be targeted by calls to _UpdateBinding_. This has two common uses: for performance, if a https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html[GameObject^] has many bindings that don't all need to be updated at the same time, different bindings can be updated individually or as a group. And, if the value behind a binding is updated but that update shouldn't be indicated to the player until some point in the future, the update can be deferred until that time.

bool _AutoUpdate_::

If this is `true`, the binding will be updated every frame, thus always keeping it up to date with the <<reference/variable-value.html,VariableValues>> it is bound to.

bool _SuppressErrors_::

If this is `true`, failure to resolve <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReferences>> when updating the binding will be considered a valid condition and therefore not log error messages.

### Public Properties

<<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> _Variables_ _(read only)_::

Returns the <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> to use to resolve <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReferences>> for this binding. The <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> will be found using <<reference/binding-root.html,BindingRoot._FindParent_>>.

### Public Methods

void UpdateBinding(string _group_, <<reference/binding-animation-status.html,BindingAnimationStatus>> _status_)::

Use this method to update this specific binding when _group_ is either `null`, empty, or matches _BindingGroup_. To update all bindings on an https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html[GameObject^], use the static _UpdateBinding_ method instead. Optionally pass a <<reference/binding-animation-status.html,BindingAnimationStatus>> instance as _status_ to access information about bindings that perform an animation or otherwise take multiple frames to complete.

### Protected Methods

void UpdateBinding(<<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> _variables_, <<reference/binding-animation-status.html,BindingAnimationStatus>> _status_) _(abstract)_::

Implement this in subclasses to perform the binding. _variables_ is the <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReferences>> should be looked up with. For bindings that take multiple frames to complete, _status_ should be updated to indicate when the binding has started and finished.

NOTE: _status_ will always be a valid instance so does not need to be checked for `null`.
