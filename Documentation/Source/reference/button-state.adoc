## ButtonState

PiRhoSoft.UtilityEngine.ButtonState : ValueType

### Description

Describes the current state of an input on the <<reference/input-helper.html,InputHelper>>. This could be a virtual button press, mouse button, touch, key, controller button, or controller axis. The properties on this class are set when the state is queried from the <<reference/input-helper.html,InputHelper>> rather than updating automatically, so the state needs to be looked up every frame to get up to date results.

### Constructors

ButtonState(bool _pressed_, bool _held_, bool _released_)::

Initializes the state to specific values.

ButtonState(string _button_)::

Initializes the state to the current state of _button_ where _button_ is a virtual button defined in the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^].

ButtonState(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html[KeyCode^] _key_)::

Initializes the state to the current state of _key_.

ButtonState(int _touch_)::

Initializes the state to the current state of the touch with index _touch_.

### Public Fields

bool _Pressed_::

If this is `true`, the queried input was not pressed on the previous frame and is on the current frame.

bool _Held_::

If this is `true`, the queried input is currently pressed. This will be `true` on the first frame (i.e when _Pressed_ is `true`).

bool _Released_::

If this is `true`, the queried input is no longer pressed but it was pressed on the previous frame.
