## InterfaceControl

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.InterfaceControl : https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^]

### Description

Add this to any https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^] to provide support for enabling and disabling the object from an <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>> using <<reference/show-control-node.html,ShowControlNode>> and <<reference/hide-control-node.html,HideControlNode>>. Read the <<topics/interface-2.html,Interface Control topic>> for more information on how and when to use InterfaceControls.

NOTE: An InterfaceControl will always start inactive.

### Public Fields

<<reference/dependent-object-list.html,DependentObjectList>> _DependentObjects_::

A list of https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObjects.html[GameObjects^] whose enabled state should always match the enabled state of this object.

### Public Properties

bool _IsActive_ _(read only)_::

`true` if the control is currently enabled, `false` otherwise.

### Public Methods

void Activate()::

Enables the control (and _DependentObjects_) if it is not already enabled. _Setup_ will be called only if the control is not already enabled.

void Deactivate()::

Disables the control (and _DependentObjects_) regardless of how many times _Activate_ was called. _Teardown_ will be called only if the control is not already disabled.

### Protected Methods

void Setup() _(virtual)_::

Implement this method in a subclass to perform setup when the object becomes enabled. The base implementation does nothing.

void Teardown() _(virtual)_::

Implement this method in a subclass to perform clean up when the object becomes disabled. The base implementation does nothing.
