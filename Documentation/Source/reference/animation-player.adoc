## AnimationPlayer

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.AnimationPlayer : https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^], <<reference/i-completion-notifier.html,ICompletionNotifier>>

### Description

Add this to any https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html[GameObject^] to provide an interface for playing https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AnimationClip.html[AnimationClips^].

### Public Properties

bool _IsComplete_ _(read only)_::

This will return true as soon as the animation has completed. If the animation has not yet started, it is not considered complete, so this will return false. If the animation is set to loop, this will always return false.

### Public Methods

void PlayAnimation(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AnimationClip.html[AnimationClip^] _animation_)::

Plays _animation_ and returns immediately.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.IEnumerator[IEnumerator^] PlayAnimationAndWait(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AnimationClip.html[AnimationClip^] _animation_)::

Plays _animation_ and returns an enumerator so it can be run as or from a https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html[coroutine^]. The enumerator will yield until _animation_ has completed. If _animation_ is set to loop, the enumerator
will break immediately and an error will be printed. Call _PlayAnimation_ instead to run looping animations.

void Pause()::

Pauses playback of the currently running animation.

void Unpause()::

Resumes playback of the currently running animation.
