## InputHelper

PiRhoSoft.UtilityEngine.InputHelper

### Description

Provides a static interface for accessing user input in a consistent manner independent of how the input was set up.

### Static Methods

void LateUpdate()::

This is called by the <<reference/composition-manager.html,CompositionManager>> to update the input state and can be ignored.

void SetButton(string _button_, bool _down_)::

Performs a virtual press (_down_ = `true`) or release (_down_ = `false`) of a button named _button_. _button_ can be any string, including those defined in https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^]. This is used by <<reference/button-input.html,ButtonInput>> to provide on screen control support.

void RemoveButton(string _button_)::

Removes the tracking data for the virtual button named _button_.

void SetAxis(string _axis_, float _value_)::

Sets the value of a virtual access named _axis_ to _value_. _axis_ can be any string, including those defined in https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^]. This is used by <<reference/button-input.html,AxisInput>> to provide on screen control support.

void RemoveAxis(string _axis_)::

Removes the tracking data for the virtual axis named _axis_.

<<reference/button-state.html,ButtonState>> GetKeyState(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html[KeyCode^] _key_)::

Returns the <<reference/button-state.html,ButtonState>> for the keyboard key _key_.

bool GetKeyDown(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html[KeyCode^] _key_)::

Returns `true` if the keyboard key _key_ is currently pressed.

bool GetWasKeyPressed(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html[KeyCode^] _key_)::

Returns `true` if the keyboard key _key_ is currently pressed and was not pressed on the previous frame.

bool GetWasKeyReleased(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html[KeyCode^] _key_)::

Returns `true` if the keyboard key _key_ is not currently pressed and was pressed on the previous frame.

bool GetIsPointerDown()::

Returns `true` if the left mouse button is currently pressed or touch with index 0 is touching the screen

bool GetWasPointerPressed()::

Returns `true` if the left mouse button is currently pressed or touch with index 0 is currently touching the screen but neither was happening on the previous frame.

bool GetWasPointerReleased()::

Returns `true` if the left mouse button or touch with index 0 is not currently pressed and was pressed on the previous frame.

<<reference/button-state.html,ButtonState>> GetTouchState(int _touch_)::

Returns the <<reference/button-state.html,ButtonState>> for the touch with index _touch_.

Nullable<https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/TouchPhase.html[TouchPhase^]> GetTouchPhase(int _touch_)::

Returns the https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/TouchPhase.html[TouchPhase^] for the touch with index _touch_. If the touch is not currently tracked, `null` will be returned.

bool GetIsTouching(int _touch_)::

Returns `true` if the touch with index _touch_ is currently touching the screen.

bool GetTouchStarted(int _touch_)::

Returns `true` if the touch with index _touch_ is currently touching the screen but was not on the previous frame.

bool GetTouchEnded(int _touch_)::

Returns `true` if the touch with index _touch_ is not currently touching the screen but was on the previous frame.

bool IsButtonAvailable(string _button_)::

Returns `true` if _button_ exists either as a virtual button created with _SetButton_ or in the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^].

<<reference/button-state.html,ButtonState>> GetButtonState(string _button_)::

Returns the <<reference/button-state.html,ButtonState>> of the virtual button or https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^] axis named _button_. If _button_ is defined as both, the virtual button state will be used.

bool GetButtonDown(string _button_)::

Returns `true` if the virtual button or https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^] axis named _button_ is pressed.

bool GetWasButtonPressed(string _button_)::

Returns `true` if the virtual button or https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^] axis named _button_ was pressed this frame.

bool GetWasButtonReleased(string _button_)::

Returns `true` if the virtual button or https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^] axis named _button_ was released this frame.

float GetAxis(string _axis_)::

Returns the value of the virtual axis or https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^] axis named _axis_. If _axis_ is defined in both places, the value with the greater magnitude will be returned.

<<reference/button-state.html,ButtonState>> GetAxisState(string _axis_, float _magnitude_)::

Returns the <<reference/button-state.html,ButtonState>> of the virtual axis or https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^] axis named _axis_ according to the same rules defined in the following 3 methods.

bool GetAxisDown(string _axis_, float _magnitude_)::

Returns `true` if the value of the virtual axis or https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^] axis named _axis_ matches the sign of and is farther from 0 than _magnitude_. If _axis_ is defined in both places, the value with the greater magnitude will be used.

bool GetWasAxisPressed(string _axis_, float _magnitude_)::

Returns `true` if the value of the virtual axis or https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^] axis named _axis_ matches the sign of and is farther from 0 than _magnitude_ and wasn't the previous frame. If _axis_ is defined in both places, the value with the greater magnitude will be used.

bool GetWasAxisReleased(string _axis_, float _magnitude_)::

Returns `true` if the value of the virtual axis or https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html[InputManager^] axis named _axis_ matched the sign of and was farther from 0 than _magnitude_ on the previous frame and isn't this frame. If _axis_ is defined in both places, the value with the greater magnitude will be used.
