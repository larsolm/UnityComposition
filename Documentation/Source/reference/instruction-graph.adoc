## InstructionGraph

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.InstructionGraph : <<reference/instruction.html,Instruction>>

### Description

The main piece of the composition system, implementing all the functionality necessary to manage and execute a set of <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNodes>>. Read the <<topics/graphs-1.html,graph topic>> for a more thorough breakdown of creating and using graphs.

### Static Fields

bool _IsDebugBreakEnabled_::

Indicates the editor should pause graph execution when it encounters a breakpoint. This is on (`true`) by default but can be turned off in the graph editor window to disable all <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,node>> breakpoints. The breakpoints are not removed, so when this setting is re-enabled, any previously set breakpoints will continue to function.

NOTE: This setting is saved with https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorPrefs.html[EditorPrefs^] so it will persist across Unity launches on the local machine for all projects.

bool _IsDebugLoggingEnabled_::

Enable this setting to log execution events when running a graph. The events that will be logged are:

* A branch has started
* A branch has been manually stopped
* Execution of a branch has completed
* Execution has paused at a breakpoint or after a step
* A connection has been followed to a new node

The current frame number is printed with the log message to make it easy to determine how many frames a particular node has taken to complete (since they are run as coroutines). Additional profiling and debugging information can be enabled with <<reference/composition-manager.html,CompositionManager._LogTracking_>>.

NOTE: This setting is saved with https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorPrefs.html[EditorPrefs^] so it will persist across Unity launches on the local machine for all projects.

### Public Methods

void GoTo(<<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> _node_, string _name_)::

Call this from a <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,node>> to tell the graph to traverse to _node_. _name_ should be the name of the property the node was assigned to for use in log messages.

The following two overloads perform the same task but can be used to provide more information in log messages when _node_ comes from a list (_index_ would be the index of _node_) or dictionary (_key_ would be the key of _node_).

* void GoTo(<<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> _node_, string _name_, int _index_)::
* void GoTo(<<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> _node_, string _name_, string _key_)::

void Break()::

Call this from a <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,node>> to tell the graph to return to the closest <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,node>> in the call stack that is an <<reference/i-loop-node.html,ILoopNode>>. The <<reference/break-node.html,BreakNode>> calls this.

void BreakAll()::

Call this from a <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,node>> to tell the graph to stop running is current branch.

### Protected Methods
