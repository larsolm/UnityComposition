## ExpressionDisplayAttribute

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.ExpressionDisplayAttribute : https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PropertyAttribute.html[PropertyAttribute^]

### Description

Apply this to an <<reference/expression.html,Expression>> field to customize the way the editor displays the <<reference/expression.html,Expression>>. If an <<reference/expression.html,Expression>> is not given this attribute, it is interpreted as if all the following properties have been set to their default value.

### Public Fields

bool _Foldout_::

If this is `true` the expression will be expandable and collapsable with a foldout. The default is `false`.

bool _FullWidth_::

If this is `true` the text area for the <<reference/expression.html,Expression>> will appear beneath its label and expanded to the full width of the inspector. Otherwise it will appear to the right of its label. The default is `true`.

int _MinimumLines_::

This specifies the minimum number of lines that will be shown in the text area regardless of the length of the <<reference/expression.html,Expression>>. The default is 2.

int _MaximumLines_::

This specifies the number of lines the text area will grow to as the <<reference/expression.html,Expression>> gets longer before using a scroll bar. The default is 8.
