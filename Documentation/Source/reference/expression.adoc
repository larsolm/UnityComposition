## Expression

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.Expression

### Description

Add this as a field on a class to provide an interface for specifying simple, repeatable operations in the editor. The full expression syntax and a guide on writing and using expressions can be found in the <<topics/expressions.html,Expressions topic>>.

### Public Properties

<<reference/expression-compilation-result.html,ExpressionCompilationResult>> _CompilationResult_ _(read only)_::

This will hold the result of the most recent expression compilation. If _HasError_ is true, this can be queried to retrieve more information about the error. That same information will be visible in the editor when viewing the expression, and any expressions that are loaded with an invalid statement will have this information logged.

<<reference/operation.html,Operation>> _LastOperation_ _(read only)_::

The last <<reference/operation.html,Operation>> that was evaluated when evaluating the expression. If an <<reference/expression-evaluation-exception.html,ExpressionEvaluationException>> is thrown, this will be the <<reference/operation.html,Operation>> that was being evaluated when the error occurred. If the evaluation is successful this will hold the last <<reference/operation.html,Operation>> in the expression.

bool _IsValid_ _(read only)_::

This will be `true` if _Statement_ has been set and was parsed successfully.

bool _HasError_ _(read only)_::

This will be `true` if _Statement_ has been set but failed to parse correctly.

string _Statement_ _(read only)_::

The statement containing the text of the expression.

### Public Methods

<<reference/expression-compilation-result.html,ExpressionCompilationResult>> SetStatement(string _statement_)::

Sets _Statement_ to _statement_ and attempts to parse it. The parse result is returned.

void GetInputs(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.IList-1[IList^]<<<reference/variable-definition.html,VariableDefinition>>> _inputs_, string _source_)::

Analyzes the expression to determine the variables that are being accessed on the variable store identified with name _source_ and adds them to _inputs_.

void GetOutputs(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.Generic.IList-1[IList^]<<<reference/variable-definition.html,VariableDefinition>>> _outputs_, string _source_)::

Analyzes the expression to determine the variables that are being set on the variable store identified with name _source_ and adds them to _outputs_.

<<reference/variable-value.html,VariableValue>> Execute(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.html[Object^] _context_, <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> _variables_)::

Evaluates the expression using _Evaluate_ and catches any <<reference/expression-evaluation-exception.html,ExpressionEvaluation>> or <<reference/command-evaluation-exception.html,CommandEvaluation>> exceptions that are thrown and logs them. _context_ should be the object that owns the expression and is passed along to the log.

<<reference/variable-value.html,VariableValue>> Execute(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.html[Object^] _context_, <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> _variables_, <<reference/variable-type.html,VariableType>> _expectedType_)::

Evaluates the expression using _Evaluate_ and catches any <<reference/expression-evaluation-exception.html,ExpressionEvaluation>> or <<reference/command-evaluation-exception.html,CommandEvaluation>> exceptions that are thrown and logs them. Additionally, the result is checked to ensure it has the <<reference/variable-type.html,VariableType>> _expectedType_ and an error is logged if it does not. _context_ should be the object that owns the expression and is passed along to the log.

<<reference/variable-value.html,VariableValue>> Evaluate(<<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> _variables_)::

Evaluates the expression using _variables_ as the root store for resolving <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReferences>>. The return value is the result of the last statement in the expression. If an error is encountered an <<reference/expression-evaluation-exception.html,ExpressionEvaluation>> or <<reference/command-evaluation-exception.html,CommandEvaluation>> exception will be thrown.
