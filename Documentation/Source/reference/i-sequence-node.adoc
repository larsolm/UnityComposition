## ISequenceNode

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.ISequenceNode

### Description

Add this interface to a custom <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> to inform an <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>> that the node should be run repeatedly. The graph will continue to run the node until the node does not call <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph._GoTo_>>.
