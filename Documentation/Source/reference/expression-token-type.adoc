PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.ExpressionTokenType

### Description

Specifies the set of <<reference/expression-token.html,ExpressionTokens>> the <<reference/expression-lexer.html,ExpressionLexer>> and <<reference/expression-parser.html,ExpressionParser>> understand.

### Values

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Sentinel_::

Seperates for two distinct statements. This is either `;` or a line break with multiple of these concatenated into a single token.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Constant_::

A <<reference/variable-value.html,VariableValue>> that has been added to the <<reference/expression-lexer.html,ExpressionLexer>> with _AddConstant_.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Type_::

A <<reference/variable-type.html,VariableType>> for use with testing the type of values.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Int_::

A literal value that should be interpreted as an int. An int is any continuous sequence of digits.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Float_::

A literal value that should be interpreted as a float. A float is any continuous sequence of digits that includes a decimal point.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _String_::

A literal value that should be interpreted as a string. A string is a sequence of characters bounded by double quotes (`"`)

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Color_::

A literal value that should be interpreted as a color. A color is a sequence of 6 digits following a hash (`#`)

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Identifier_::

A name that is used to look up variable values. Identifiers can be any sequence of letters, numbers, spaces, or underscores beginning with a letter or underscore.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Command_::

A name that is used to look up a <<reference/i-command.html,Command>> that has been registered with the <<reference/expression-parser.html,ExpressionParser>> using _AddCommand_. A command is an _Identifier_ that is followed by an opening paren (`(`).

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Operator_::

An operator that is used to look up a <<reference/prefix-operation.html,PrefixOperation>> or <<reference/prefix-operation.html,InfixOperation>> that has been registered with the <<reference/expression-parser.html,ExpressionParser>> using _AddPrefixOperator_ or _AddInfixOperator_. Valid operator characters are any of `+-!^*/%<>=&|?.` in any sequence and any character sequence that has been registered with the <<reference/expression-lexer.html,ExpressionLexer>> using _AddKeyword_.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _StartLookup_::

Indicates the following tokens should be interpreted as part of a <<reference/variable-handler.html,variable lookup>>. This is the `[` character.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _EndLookup_::

Indicates the following tokens are no longer part of a <<reference/variable-handler.html,variable lookup>>. This is the `]` character.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _StartGroup_::

Indicates the following tokens should be isolated and evaluated as a group, just as would be done in a math expression. This is the `(` character.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _EndGroup_::

Ends a group that was started with a _StartGroup_ token or a command that was started with a _Command_ token. This is the `)` character.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Separator_::

Seperates parameters in a _Command_ token. This is the `,` character.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Alternation_::

This is the character used as the separator for the true and false statements of a ternary expression. This is the `:` character.

<<reference/expression-token-type.html,ExpressionTokenType>> _Unknown_::

Any token that does not meet the requirements for one of the preceding types will be given this type.
