## CompositionManager

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.CompositionManager : <<reference/global-behaviour-1.html,GlobalBehaviour>><<<reference/composition-manager.html,CompositionManager>>>

### Description

Globally manages execution of <<reference/instruction.html,Instructions>>. A single instance of this https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^] will be created automatically and can be accessed from the static _Instance_ property.

### Static Fields

string _GlobalStoreName_::

The name to use to access _GlobalStore_ from _DefaultStore_ or any <<reference/instruction-store.html,InstructionStore>>.

string _SceneStoreName_::

The name to use to access _SceneStore_ from _DefaultStore_ or any <<reference/instruction-store.html,InstructionStore>>.

string _CommandFolder_::

The name of the folder that any custom <<reference/command.html,Commands>> are placed in. By default this is "Commands". All folders with this name that are inside a folder called "Resources" will be loaded when the CompositionManager is created.

bool _LogTracking_::

When this is true, information gathered in editor builds about the execution of <<reference/instruction.html,Instructions>> will be logged to the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Console.html[console^]. This will include the number of enumerator iterations, the number of frames, and the amount of time it took to complete execution of each <<reference/instruction.html,Instruction>>. The <<topics/graphs/debugging.html,Watch Window>> in the editor exposes this variable as a toggle.

### Public Properties

<<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> _DefaultStore_ _(read only)_::

An <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> that exposes _GlobalStore_ under the name _GlobalStoreName_ and _SceneStore_ under the name _SceneStoreName_.

<<reference/variable-store.html,VariableStore>> _GlobalStore_ _(read only)_::

An <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> that stores user defined values which can be arbitrarily added, changed, and removed.

<<reference/scene-variable-store.html,SceneVariableStore>> _SceneStore_ _(read only)_::

An <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> implementation that allows scene objects to be looked up by name.

### Public Methods

void RunInstruction(<<reference/instruction.html,Instruction>> _instruction_, <<reference/variable-value.html,VariableValue>> _context_)::

Runs an <<reference/instruction.html,Instruction>>, usually an <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>>, without setting any inputs other than _context_ or reading any outputs.

void RunInstruction(<<reference/instruction-caller.html,InstructionCaller>> _caller_, <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> _store_, <<reference/variable-value.html,VariableValue>> _context_)::

Runs an <<reference/instruction.html,Instruction>>, usually an <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>>, reading the inputs specified in _caller_ from _store_ to an <<reference/instruction-store.html,InstructionStore>> that is passed to the instruction, and reading the outputs from that <<reference/instruction-store.html,InstructionStore>> to _store_ when _caller_ has completed.

Read more about <<reference/instruction.html,Instruction>> inputs and outputs in the <<topics/graphs/instruction-store.html,Instruction Store>> topic.
