## Cutoff

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.Cutoff : <<reference/transition.html,Transition>>

### Description

Provides a custom https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Shader.html[Shader^] with an interface to fade, distort, and dissolve the screen image over time using an input texture. <<reference/fade.html,Fade>>, <<reference/disolve.html,Dissolve>>, and <<reference/distort.html,Distort>> derive from this class to provide specific <<reference/transition.html,Transition>> functionality.

### Protected Methods

void SetTexture(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Texture2D.html[Texture2D^] _texture_)::

Sets the _TransitionTexture_ property of the material which is used to lookup the animation properties according to the description in the <<manual/cutoff.html,manual>>.

void SetColor(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Color.html[Color^] _color_)::

Sets the _Color property of the material.

void SetCutoff(float _cutoff_)::

Sets the _Cutoff property of the material which specifies the portion of the texture that is used as the mask based on the current elapsed time.

void SetFade(float _fade_)::

Sets the _Fade property of the material which specifies the interpolated position between the color from the input texture and the value set to _Color.

void SetDistort(bool _distort_)::

Sets the _Distort property which indicates whether or not the material should distort the input texture based on the R and G channels in _TransitionTexture.

void Setup() _(virtual)_::

Override this in subclasses to set additional material properties. The base implementation sets _TransitionTexture_ to https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Texture2D-blackTexture.html[Texture2D.blackTexture], _color_ to black, and _Distort_ to false. _Cutoff_ and _Fade_ are set in <<reference/transition.html,_Process_>> to the percentage of <<reference/transition.html,_Duration_>> that has elapsed.
