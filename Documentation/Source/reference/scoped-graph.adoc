## ScopedGraph

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.ScopedGraph : <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>>

### Description

An <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>> with an entry branch, a main branch, and an exit branch. These branches will run in sequence but for organization purposes it is useful to think of _Enter_ as a setup branch and _Exit_ a cleanup branch that reverses any changes made in _Enter_.

### Public Fields

<<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> _Enter_::

The branch that will run when the <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>> is first run.

<<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> _Process_::

The branch that will run after _Enter_ has completed.

<<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> _Exit_::
