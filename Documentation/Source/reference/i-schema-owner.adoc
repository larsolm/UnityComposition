[#reference/i-schema-owner]

## ISchemaOwner

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.ISchemaOwner

### Description

Implement this interface on a class that also implements <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStore>> to indicate to other systems that this store is constrained by a <<reference/variable-schema.html,VariableSchema>>. This is used to improve the editing experience and enable runtime serialization of the store data. The built in classes <<reference/constrained-store.html,ConstrainedStore>>, <<reference/variable-set-component.html,VariableSetComponent>>, and <<reference/variable-set-asset.html,VariableSetAsset>> implement this and should be sufficient for most use cases.

### Public Properties

<<reference/variable-schema.html,VariableSchema>> _Schema_ _(read only)_ _(abstract)_::

The <<reference/variable-schema.html,VariableSchema>> that is constraining this store.

### Public Methods

void SetupSchema() _(abstract)_::

This method should apply the schema to the store.
