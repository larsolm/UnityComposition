## InstructionReferenceNode

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.InstructionReferenceNode : <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>>

### Description

An <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> that runs an external <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>> that is looked up from a <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReference>>. Because the <<reference/instruction-graph.html,graph>> is looked up dynamically, inputs and outputs cannot be used.

### Public Fields

<<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,InstructionGraphNode>> _Next_::

The node to run after this node has completed.

<<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReference>> _Instruction_::

A variable containing the <<reference/instruction-graph.html,InstructionGraph>> to run when this node is entered. <<reference/instruction-store.html,InstructionStore._Local_>> variables available to this node are not transferred to this graph - to share variables use the <<reference/instruction-store.html,InstructionStore._Global_>> store or _Context_.

<<reference/variable-value-source.html,VariableValueSource>> _Context_::

The variable to use as the <<reference/instruction-store.html,InstructionStore._Context_>> for _Instruction_.

bool _WaitForCompletion_::

If `true`, _Next_ will not be run until execution of _Instruction_ is complete. If `false`, _Next_ will be run immediately and continue in parallel with _Instruction_.
