## Transition

PiRhoSoft.CompositionEngine.Transition : https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html[ScriptableObject^]

### Description

The base class for assets that perform postprocessing of the rendered scene over a time period.

### Public Fields

float _Duration_::

The time in seconds the transition should last.

### Public Methods

void Begin(<<reference/transition-phase.html,TransitionPhase>> _phase_) _(virtual)_::

Implement this to setup properties when the transition is started.

void Process(float _time_, <<reference/transition-phase.html,TransitionPhase>> _phase_) _(virtual)_::

Implement this to animate properties of the transition as time advances.

void End() _(virtual)_::

Implement this to perform any clean up of the transition.

void Render(https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html[RenderTexture^] _source_, https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html[RenderTexture^] _destination_) _(virtual)_::

Renders the transition using _source_ as the input scene and _destination_ as the target. The https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Graphics.Blit.html[Graphics._Blit_^] methods are used to copy the texture using _Material_. To fully customize rendering, this can be overridden, but for must situations updating properties of _Material_ in _Update_ is sufficient.

### Protected Properties

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html[Material^] _Material_ _(read only)_::

The https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material.html[Material^] the effect will be rendered with. This is created with a call to _SetShader_.

### Protected Methods

void SetShader(string _name_)::

Creates the material using the specified shader. _name_ is the name set for the shader at the beginning of the shader script. This should be called from subclasses during initialization.

void Update() _(virtual)_::

Implement this to update the https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MaterialsAccessingViaScript.html[material properties^] of _Material_.
