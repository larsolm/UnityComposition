## Play Transition Node

A Play Transition Node is an <<manual/instruction-graph-node.html,Instruction Graph Node>> that tells the <<manual/transition-manager.html,Transition Manager>> to begin a <<manual/transition.html,Transition>>. If the _AutoFinish_ field is set then the <<manual/transition.html,Transition>> will complete automatically once its phase is completed, otherwise, either a new <<manual/transition.html,Transition>> needs to be started or a <<manual/stop-transition-node.html,Stop Transition Node>> needs to be used. A standard example for when _AutoFinish_ should be `false` would be to maintain the blank screen after fading out while loading the next scene then fading back in when the loading is done. Create a Play Transition Node in the menu:Create[Sequencing > Play Transition] menu of the Instruction Graph Window.

See <<topics/graphs/overview.html,Graphs>> for more information on instruction graphs. +
See the _"MazeStart"_ <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> in the Maze project for an example usage.
