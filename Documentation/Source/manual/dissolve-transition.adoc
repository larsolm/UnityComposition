[#manual/dissolve-transition]

## Dissolve Transition

Dissolve is an implementation of a <<manual/cutoff-transition.html,Cutoff Transition>> <<manual/transition.html,Transition>> that will fade the screen based on an input https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Texture.html[Texture^] over the duration of the <<manual/transition.html,Transition>>. The blue component of the texture will be read as the value of the cutoff. Higher values will take longer to dissolve - values of 0 will be _Color_ right from the beginning of the <<manual/transition.html,Transition>>, and values of 255 will not dissolve to _Color_ until the end of the <<manual/transition.html,Transition>>. If _Texture_ is null, a https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Texture.html[Texture^] will automatically be generated with perlin noise to create a smooth looking transition. Create a Dissolve through the menu:Create[PiRho Soft > Transitions > Dissolve] menu in the project view.
