[#manual/instruction-node]

## Instruction Node

An Instruction Node is an <<manual/instruction-graph-node.html,Instruction Graph Node>> that executes a different <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>>. Intruction Nodes can pass in a new _Context_ object to _Instruction_ and optionally _WaitForCompletion_ of the called <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> before moving on to the next node. Create an Instruction Node in the menu:Create[Composition > Instruction] menu of the Instruction Graph Window.

See the _"Take Turn"_ node on the "BoardLoop" <<instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> in the BoardGame project for an example usage.
