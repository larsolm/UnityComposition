[#manual/instruction-node]

## Instruction Node

An Instruction Node is an <<manual/instruction-graph-node.html,Instruction Graph Node>> that executes a different <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>>. Intruction Nodes can pass in a new _Context_ object to the <<manual/instruction-graph.html,graph>> and optionally _WaitForCompletion_ of the called <<manual/instruction-graph.html,graph>> before moving on to the next node. Create an Instruction Node in the menu:Create[Composition > Instruction] menu of the Instruction Graph Window.

See <<topics/graphs-1.html,Graphs>> for more information on instruction graphs. +
See the _"Take Turn"_ node on the _"BoardLoop"_ <<instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> in the BoardGame project for an example usage.
