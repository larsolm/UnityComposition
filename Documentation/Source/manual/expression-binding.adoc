## Expression Binding

Expression Binding is a <<manual/string-binding.html,String Binding>> that will run an <<reference/expression.html,Expression>> and bind its output as the displayed string. If _Expression_ evaluates to a float or an int, then customized <<reference/binding-formatter.html,Formatting>> can be applied. If _Expression_ is invalid, then the text component will be disabled.

See the _"MazeUi"_ scene in the Maze project for an example usage.
