## Expression Binding

Expression Binding is a <<manual/string-binding.html,String Binding>> that will run an <<reference/expression.html,Expression>> and bind its output as the displayed string. If _Expression_ evaluates to a float or an int, then customized <<reference/binding-formatter.html,Formatting>> can be applied. If _Expression_ is invalid, then the text component will be disabled.

See <<topics/bindings-3.html,Variable Bindings>> for more information. +
See <<topics/variables-5.html,Expressions>> for more information. +
See the _"MazeUi"_ scene in the Maze project for an example usage.
