## Conditional Node

A Conditional Node is an <<manual/instruction-graph-node.html,Instruction Graph Node>> that branches the progression of an <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> based on the `true` or `false` evaluation of an <<reference/expression.html,Expression>>. Create a Conditional Node in the menu:Create[Control Flow > Conditional] menu of the Instruction Graph Window.

See the _"HasKey"_ node in "MazeDoor" <<instruction-graph,Instruction Graph>> in the Maze project for an example usage.
