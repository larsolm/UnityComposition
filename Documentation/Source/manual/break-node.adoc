## Break Node

A Break Node is an <<instruction-graph-node,Instruction Graph Node>> that will force the most recent link:reference/i-loop-node[ILoopNode] to stop running. link:reference/i-loop-node[ILoopNode] is implemented by <<loop-node,Loop Node>> and <<iterate-node,Iterate Node>>.

See the _"BoardLoop"_ <<instruction-graph,Instruction Graph>> in the BoardGame project for an example usage.
