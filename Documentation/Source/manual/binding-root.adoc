## Binding Root

Binding Root is a https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^] that acts as a root object for all child <<variable-binding,Variable Bindings>> to bind data on. Binding Roots have a _Value_ property that can be accessed through link:reference/variable-reference.html[Variable References] via the _Name_ property.  _Value_ can be set from a derived class such as <<object-binding-root,Object Binding Root>> or through a <<set-binding-node,Set Binding Node>>. When accessing variables on a Binding Root, the search will cascade upward to the next Binding Root in the hierarchy with the the default variable store on the <<composition-manager,Composition Manager>> as the base. <<selection-control,Selection Controls>> and <<menu,Menus>> use Binding Roots on each of their child <<menu-item,Menu Items>> to group each item's data.

See the _"Card"_ prefab in the CardGame project for an example usage.
