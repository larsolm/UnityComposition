## Variable Binding

A Variable Binding is an abstract https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^] used to bind data from the composition system, usually via <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReferences>> to visual elements in the scene. By default a Variable Binding has access to the <<manual/composition-manager.html,Composition Manager>>'s "global" and "scene" <<reference/i-variable-store.html,IVariableStores>>. If a Variable Binding has a parent or parents with a <<manual/binding-root.html,Binding Root>> then they can access the _Value_ property on those <<manual/binding-root.html,Binding Roots>> via their _ValueName_ property. Variable Bindings can be categorized into groups with the _BindingGroup_ property so that only certain bindings will update when they are prompted to (usually by an <<manual/update-binding-node,Update Binding Node>>. If _AutoUpdate_ is set then Variable Bindings will update automatically every frame. Most Variable Bindings will disable their corresponding visual element if they fail to retreive their data and report the error, however, sometimes this may be intended behaviour so if set, _SuppressErrors_ will hide those errors. Some example implementations of a Variable Binding are <<manual/enable-binding.html,Enable Binding>>, <<manual/image-binding.html,Image Binding>>, and <<manual/string-binding.html,String Binding>>.

See <<topics/bindings-3.html,Variable Bindings>> for more information. +
