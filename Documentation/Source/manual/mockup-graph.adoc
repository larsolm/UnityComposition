## Mockup Graph

A Mockup Graph is an implementation of an <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> usually used for storyboarding and prototyping in conjunction with <<manual/mockup-node.html,Mockup Nodes>>. A Mockup Graph can be customized to have any number of entry points and are useful to create as a visual template that is turned into a real <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> later.

See <<topics/graphs-1.html,Graphs>> for more information on instruction graphs. +
