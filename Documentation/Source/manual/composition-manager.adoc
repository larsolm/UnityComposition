## Composition Manager

The Composition Manager is a https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^] that acts as the object that manages the entire composition system. Because Composition Manager is a link:/projects/unity-utilities/documentation/#/v10/reference/global-behaviour-1[GlobalBehaviour^], it is created automatically the first time it is accessed so it does not need to be added to any objects in a scene. If manually running an <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> from script, do it through the `Run()` method on the Composition Manager
