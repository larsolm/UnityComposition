## Text Input Binding

Text Input Binding is a <<manual/variable-binding.html,Variable Binding>> that will receive input on a sibling http://digitalnativestudios.com/textmeshpro/docs/[TextMeshProInputField^] component and assign the text to the <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReference>>, _Variable_. This is a two-way binding so if `UpdateBindings()` is called on this <<manual/variable-binding.html,Variable Binding>>, then the displayed text will also be updated.

See <<topics/bindings/variable-bindings.html,Variable Bindings>> for more information. +
