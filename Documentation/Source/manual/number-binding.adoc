## Number Binding

Number Binding is a <<manual/string-binding.html,String Binding>> that will bind text based on a <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReference>> to an int or float with customized <<reference/binding-formatter.html,Formatting>> applied. If _Variable_ is invalid or does not return an int or float, then the text component will be disabled.

See the _"Amount"_ object in the _"Shop"_ scene of the Shop project for an example usage.
