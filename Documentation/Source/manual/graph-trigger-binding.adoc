## Graph Trigger Binding

Graph Trigger Binding is a <<manual/variable-binding.html,Variable Binding>> that runs an <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> when a given <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariablesReference>> changes. _Graph_ will always run the first time `UpdateBindings()` is called and it will not run again if it is already running.

See the _"Maze3"_ scene in the Maze project for an example usage.
