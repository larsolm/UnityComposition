## Load Scene Node

A Load Scene Node is an <<manual/instruction-graph-node.html,Instruction Graph Node>> that will load a new https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SceneManagement.Scene.html[Scene^]. The scene to be loaded can based on a <<reference/scene-reference.html,SceneReference>>, string name, build index, or a <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReference>> to a string name or build index. If _WaitForCompletion_ is specified, the graph will not move to the next node until the scene has fully completed loading. Create a Load Scene Node in the menu:Create[Sequencing > Load Scene] menu of the Instruction Graph Window.

See <<topics/graphs-1.html,Graphs>> for more information on instruction graphs. +
See the _"Load UI"_ node on the _"MazeStart"_ <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> in the Maze project for an example usage.
