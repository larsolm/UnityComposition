## Variable Pool Asset

A Variable Pool Asset is a https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html[ScriptableObject^] that adds a <<reference/variable-pool.html,Variable Pool>> to the asset. This allows it to have a list of <<reference/variable-value.html,Variables>> without being constrained by a <<manual/variable-schema.html,Variable Schema>>. Create a Variable Pool Asset through the menu:Create[PiRho Soft > Variable Pool] menu in the project view.

See the _"Loot Equipment Pickup"_ prefab in the Loot project for an example usage.
