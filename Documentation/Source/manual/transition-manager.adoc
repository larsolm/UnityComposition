## Transition Manager

The Transition Manager is a https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^] that manages the transition post-processing system. Because Transition Manager is a link:/projects/unity-utilities/documentation/#/v10/reference/global-behaviour-1[GlobalBehaviour^], it is created automatically the first time it is accessed so it does not need to be added to any objects in a scene. The Transition Manager works in conjunction with <<manual/transition-renderer.html,Transition Renderers>>, attached to https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Camera.html[Cameras^] to render post processing effects onto the screen. Generally, <<manual/transition.html,Transitions>> are started by a <<manual/play-transition-node.html,Play Transition Node>>, however, they can be run from script using the `RunTransition()` or `StartTransition()` method. The methods are both https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Collections.IEnumerator[IEnumerators^] and should be called using the https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.StartCoroutine.html[MonoBehaviour.StartCoroutine()^] method. `RunTransition()` will fully run the given <<reference/transition-phase,Phase>> of the <<manual/transition.html,Transition>>, ending it once it has finished, while `StartTransition()` will run the <<manual/transition.html,Transition>> until the end without clearing, maintaining its final state until `EndTransition()` is called or a new <<manual/transition.html,Transition>> is started. << Only a single <<manual/transition.html,Transition>> can be running at a time.
