## Play Effect

A Play Effect Node is an <<manual/instruction-graph-node.html,Instruction Graph Node>> that will spawn a prefab at the given Name, Position, and Rotation relative to the world, another object, or as a child object. The created effect can optionally be stored in a given <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReference>> so that it can be accessed later. This differs from a standard <<manual/create-game-object-node.html,Create Game Object Node>> in that a Play Effect Node can _WaitForCompletion_ of the effect and destroy it when it is finished. The created effect object is queried for https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ParticleSystem.html[ParticleSystems^] and other components that implement <<reference/i-completion-notifier.html,ICompletionNotifier>> to determine when the effect is finished. Create a Play Effect Node in the menu:Create[Animation > Play Effect] menu of the Instruction Graph Window.

See the _"Play Jewel Sparkle"_ node on the _"MazeJewel"_ <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>> in the Maze project for an example usage.
