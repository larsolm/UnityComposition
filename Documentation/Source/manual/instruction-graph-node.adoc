An abstract https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html[Asset^] that is the main component of an <<manual/instruction-graph.html,Instruction Graph>>. This base class has no functionality itself appart from helper methods that may be called from derived classes (see <<reference/instruction-graph-node.html,Reference>>). To implement custom functionality for a node, simply derive and implement the `Run()` method.
