## Variable Set Component

A Variable Set Component is a https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviour^] that adds a <<reference/variable-pool.html,Variable Set>> to the object. This allows it to have a list of <<reference/variable-value.html,Variables>> that are defined by a reference to a <<manual/variable-schema.html,Variable Schema>>. A derived class of Variable Set Component can use the <<reference/mapped-variable-attribute.html,MappedVariableAttribute>> to add its fields and properties to the _Variables_ list in addition to those defined by _Schema_.

See the _"Triangle"_ and _"Hexagon"_ objects in the _"Battle"_ scene of the Battle project for an example usage.
See the _"Player"_ script in the Maze project for an example implementation that uses <<reference/mapped-variable-attribute.html,mapped variables>>.
