## Variable Set Asset

A Variable Set Asset is a https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html[ScriptableObject^] that adds a <<reference/variable-pool.html,Variable Set>> to the asset. This allows it to have a list of <<reference/variable-value.html,Variables>> that are defined by a reference to a <<manual/variable-schema.html,Variable Schema>>. A derived class of Variable Set Asset can use the <<reference/mapped-variable-attribute.html,MappedVariableAttribute>> to add its fields and properties to the _Variables_ list in addition to those defined by _Schema_. Create a Variable Set Asset through the menu:Create[PiRho Soft > Variable Set] menu in the project view.

See the assets in the _"Moves"_ and _"Items"_ folders in the Battle project for an example usage.
