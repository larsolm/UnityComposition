## Bindings

### Overview

The Bindings system is used to bind data from the composition system, usually via <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReferences>> to elements in a scene. Commonly this is used to automatically update visual elements, like text, to display values stored in code, for example, showing the health of a character, or the amount of money a player has. The two main components of the binding system are <<manual/binding-root.html,Binding Roots>> and <<manual/variable-binding.html,Variable Bindings>>.
