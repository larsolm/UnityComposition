## Graphs

### Overview

Intruction Graphs are the main feature of the composition system. Graphs work similarly to flow chart. When run, they traverse a tree of nodes which each execute their own logic. Graphs can branch and loop based on variables, expressions, input, or any other custom logic. The power of graphs comes in the way they allowing timing and sequencing of game logic to occur. Whereas waiting on actions and events in script can be difficult to manage, graphs provide a simple to use visual interface for interacting with your game world to create things like, cutscenes, dialog trees, menus, scene transitions and even entire game systems, without the need to write lengthy scripts. The benefit of graphs is that they can work dynamically based on variables in your game world, with each graph able to perform different actions based on the object that is executing the graph and the inputs provided to it. Robust debugging is possible with breakpoints, runtime variable editing, and extensive error logging. In addition to supporting most of Unity's built in systems, graphs are also easily extensible to your own game logic by simply creating custom nodes which can then provide any desired functionality.

### Workflow

Create and edit graphs using the Instruction Graph Window (menu:Window[PiRho Soft > Instruction Graph]).

### Nodes

### Branching, Loops and Sequences

### Context/Inputs/Outputs

### Automatic casting

### Instruction Caller

### Debugging (break points, watch window)

### Running Graphs From Script

### Creating Custom Graphs
