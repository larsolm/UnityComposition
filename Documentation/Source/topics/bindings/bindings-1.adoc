## Overview

The Bindings system is used to bind data from the composition system, usually via <<reference/variable-reference.html,VariableReferences>>, to elements in a scene. Commonly this is used to automatically update visual elements, like text, to display values stored in code, for example, showing the health of a character, or the amount of money a player has. The two main components of the binding system are <<manual/binding-root.html,Binding Roots>> and <<manual/variable-binding.html,Variable Bindings>>. Variable Bindings are the specific https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html[MonoBehaviours^] that alter properties of other behaviours, while Binding Roots provide the variable bindings with access to the <<topics/variables-1.html,variables>> that hold the data to be bound to. Within a binding group, variable bindings can be further categorized into groups so each group can be individually updated. Bindings can be animated and the instruction graph can interface with the animation's progress to for sequencing. In addition to numerous built-in variable binding types, bindings can be easily extended to perform custom behaviour.
