 Copyright Â© PiRhoSoft, Inc
---------------------------------

Getting Started:
----------------
o Import the TextMeshPro Essentials by going opening the "Edit/Project Settings" window. Find the "TextMesh Pro" section on the left and click on the "Import TMP Essentials" button.
o To run the examples you MUST add all the scenes to the build settings. To do this automatically, click on the menu item "Tools/Add Examples to Build"
o Open the "Loader" scene located in the "Assets/Composition Framework/Examples/Loader" folder.
o Play the Loader scene and choose which example you want to run from the menu.
o Examples can be played using a mouse, controller, or keyboard (Board Game, Calculator, and Card Game are mouse only).
o Each example can be played directly by loading the corresponding scene in the editor (LootMenu and MazeUi cannot be run directly - use LootLevel or Maze1/2/3 instead).
o To view the documentation open the "Documentation.html" file located in "Assets/Composition Framework/Documentation" folder in a web browser.
o Visit "https://pirhosoft.com/projects/unity-composition/documentation/#/v10/" for the most up to date online documentation and tutorial videos.
o To use the framework on its own simply delete the "Examples" folder or choose to not import it initially. The "PiRhoSoft Composition" and "PiRhoSoft Utilities" folders are required.
