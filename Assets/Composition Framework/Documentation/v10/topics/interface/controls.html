<p>An <a href="#manual/interface-control.html">Interface Control</a> is a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MonoBehaviour</a> that acts as the base class for all controls in the interface system. They should be attached to objects in a UI scene that are to be shown and hidden by the composition system (like dialog boxes, and menus). When loaded an Interface Control always starts inactive until the <code>Activate()</code> method is called. This usually happens from a <a href="#manual/show-control-node.html">Show Control Node</a> on a <a href="#topics/graphs/overview.html">graph</a>. Interface Controls also maintain a list of other <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameObjects</a> in a scene that should be activated and deactivated along with this control. To deactivate a control use a <a href="#manual/hide-control-node.html">Hide Control Node</a> or manually call the <code>Deactivate()</code> method from script.</p>
