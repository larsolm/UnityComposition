<p>A Scoped Graph is an implementation of <a href="#manual/instruction-graph.html">Instruction Graph</a> with three sequential entry points for <a href="manual/instruction-graph-node.html">Nodes</a>, <em>"Enter"</em>, <em>"Process"</em>, and <em>"Exit"</em>. This is useful for organization of nodes that should have parity of actions when they are starting and finishing (such as disabling and reenabling objects).</p>
